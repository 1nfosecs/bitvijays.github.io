Iâ€™m programmer, and computer security enthusiast. This blog was started to document all the cool things I learn and to share it with the people who might find it useful.

Currently, I am trying to learning using VulHub Machines, next in plan is to read tutorials on Cyberaces.org and enroll in OSCP.
