Hello    :)

Iâ€™m programmer and computer security enthusiast. This blog was started to document all the cool things I learn and to share it with the people who might find it useful and helpful.

Currently, I am trying to learn penetration testing using <a href="http://vulnhub.com/">VulHub</a> Machines, next in plan is to read tutorials on Cyberaces.org and enroll in <a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/">OSCP</a>.
