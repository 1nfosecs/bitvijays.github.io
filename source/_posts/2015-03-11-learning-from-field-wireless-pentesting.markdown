###Special thanks to Girish Nemade

Recently, We got a chance to do some penetration testing. This post would cover the basics and approach.

Basic wireless network tests could be performed by using your wireless adapter installed in your laptop. However, few external USB cards are suggested by Offsec such as
<ol type=i>
<li>Netgear WN111v2 USB</li>
<li>ALFA Networks AWUS036H USB 500mW</li>
</ol>which provide a better area coverage.

<strong>Basics:</strong>

<ol>
<li>Set the wireless interface in the monitor mode.
```
airmon-ng <start|stop> <interface> [channel] : Enable monitor mode on an interface (and specify a channel).
airmon-ng <check> [kill]                     : List all possible programs that could interfere with the wireless card. If 'kill' is specified, it will try to kill all of them.
```
</li>
<li>Use airodump

```
airodump <monitor interface>
-N, --essid                 : Filter APs by ESSID.                                  ##Name of the Access Point
-d <bssid>, --bssid <bssid> : It will only show networks, matching the given bssid. ##MAC Address of Access Point
-a                          : It will only show associated clients.
 -t <OPN|WEP|WPA|WPA1|WPA2>, --encrypt <OPN|WEP|WPA|WPA1|WPA2> : It will only show networks matching the given encryption.

```
